    <h2>Why I chose Wed Development?</h2>
    <p>
        When I was in interschool I got fascinated with the programming languages and we all get when we see someone doing stuff like that, from that day I started searching about programming languages over the youtube and watched some introductional videos. <br>
        Then, I chose python as my first programming language beacuse it's easy to learn as a beginner. <br>
        After that I started learning Web Development and still doing it. <br>
        Also, I have learnt C programming language as it's a very important programming language and used to design various programming languages.
    </p>
