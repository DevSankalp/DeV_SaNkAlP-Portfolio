            <h2>Why I chose Web Development?</h2>
            <p>
                When I was in interschool I got fascinated with the programming languages and we all get when we see someone doing stuff like that, from that day I started searching about programming languages over the youtube and watched some introductional videos. <br>
                Then, I chose python as my first programming language beacuse it's easy to learn as a beginner. <br>
                After that I started learning Web Development because it has wide course to explore and learn.<br>
                Also, I have learnt C programming language as it's a very important programming language and used to design serious stuff.
            </p>
